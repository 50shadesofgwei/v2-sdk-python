# Python SDK for HMXv2

This library is tested against Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.9, and 3.11.

## Installation

This package is available on PyPI. To install run the command below:

## Getting Started

The `Client` object contains two major attributes: Public and Private. As the names suggest, Public is for public functions that don't require an Ethereum private key, and Private is for functions specifically for the given key. For more comprehensive examples, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/HMXOrg/v2-sdk-python/tree/main/examples) directory as well as the [tests](https://github.com/HMXOrg/v2-sdk-python/tree/main/tests).
